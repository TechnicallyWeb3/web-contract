# web-contract
A package to deploy your react app as a smart contract for use with a web3 browser.

## Using Tasks

This project includes several Hardhat tasks to help you deploy, manage, and interact with your smart contract. Here's how to use them:

## Build Folder
To build your react app you'll need to open your project in a new terminal window and run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a build folder with the react app's code, which you will need to copy into the build folder of this project.

### Deploy Contract

To deploy the WebContract or use an existing deployment:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy-contract [action] --network <network-name>
```
- `[action]`: Optional. Use 'redeploy' to force redeployment.
- `--network`: Optional. The network to deploy to, if not specified, the hardhat VM network will be used.

Note: After deployment, the contract address is automatically added to the `package.json` file under the `"contract"` key.

### Upload to IPFS

To upload specific files or the entire build folder to IPFS:

```bash
npx hardhat upload-ipfs-assets [files...] --network <network-name>
```
- `[files...]`: Optional. Specific files to upload. If not specified, the entire build folder will be processed.
- `--network`: Optional. The network to upload to, if not specified, the hardhat VM network will be used.

### Write to Contract

To write specific files or the entire build folder to the smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat write-to-contract [filePath] --network <network-name>
```
- `[filePath]`: Optional. Relative path of the file to upload (from build folder). If not specified, the entire build folder will be processed.
- `--network`: Optional. The network to write to, if not specified, the hardhat VM network will be used.

### Read from Contract

To read files from the smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat read-from-contract <fileName> --network <network-name>
```
- `<fileName>`: Required. The name of the file to read.
- `--network`: Optional. The network to read from, if not specified, the hardhat VM network will be used.
